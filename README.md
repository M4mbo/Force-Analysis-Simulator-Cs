# Force-Analysis-Simulator-C-
Interactive simulator for physics problem implementing the concepts of induction and force analysis.

The problem in question is included in the "Force Anlysis" PDF file.

Once running, one can check the changes in velocity, acceleration and position over time (t = 0 being the start of the simulation). The table in the middle presents the change in these magnitudes for every 0.2 seconds. A visualization of each function is also displayed on the right side. One can choose which function (v, a or s) to display with the buttons at the bottom of the window.

The user can also change the values for block mass(M), bar mass (m), resistance(R), magnetic field (B), and length of the bar (l).
